		abstract: 'Flow matching (FM) has emerged as a promising simulation-free alternative to diffusion models for generative modeling. However, current FM methods rely on predefined, typically linear, paths for transporting data to a noise distribution, which may not be optimal for capturing the complex transformations required for high-fidelity generation. To address this limitation, we introduce Ouroboros, a novel approach that learns the temporal flow paths themselves through reinforcement learning (RL). Ouroboros leverages an RL agent to dynamically construct the vector field, optimizing the path for a more efficient and effective generation process. This reinforcement-guided approach allows for the discovery of non-linear, data-dependent paths that can better preserve the intricate details and structure of the data distribution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Ouroboros on various image generation benchmarks, showing that it outperforms existing FM methods in terms of sample quality and likelihood scores. Our findings suggest that optimizing the flow path is a critical and previously overlooked aspect of flow matching models, opening new avenues for advancing generative modeling.',
